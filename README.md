# Bodyfat Estimation

This repository describes my approche to predict bodyfat percentage with a regression model.

You can read and find the whole process in the bodyfat-estimation jupyter notebook.

This jupyter notebook uses the Bodyfat Prediction Dataset that you can find here :

To be able to execute code cells, do not forget to update the path to the dataset you've downloaded.

Finally, you can find the trained model in the rf_bodyfat_estimator.pkl file.
